## Quick Sort
Created by: CrazyCats (Tania Cao, Frank Chen, Xinyi Huang)

### Hypothesis
The execution-time of the best case will be O(nlogn), where the array is already sorted. The execution-time of the worst case will be O(n^2), where the array is __________. The execution-time of the average or most likely case is o(n^2logn), where the array is neither the best case or worst case.

### Background
The array consists of at least one integer. Each array generated will have integers placed in random order.

### Experiment
The algorithm we've developed would execute the following...
1. Create an array
2. Populate the array and shuffle them so they are in random order
3. Sort the array using QuickSort
4. Record the execution time 
5. Repeat steps 1-4 ninety-nine times (total number of trials: 100)

### Results
![]()

### Conclusion
Our hypothesis is ______. According to the data we've gathered, the execution-time . Due to the fact that the pivot starts out in the middle of the array, the execution time
