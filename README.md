### Hypothesis
The execution-time of the best case will be O(n) and the worst case will be O(n^2).

### Background
The array consists of at least one integer. Each array generated will have integers placed in random order.

### Experiment
The algorithm we've developed would execute the following...
1. Create an array
2. Populate the array and shuffle them so they are in random order
3. Sort the array using QuickSort
4. Record the execution time 
5. Repeat steps 1-4 ninety-nine times (total number of trials: 100)

### Results
![]()

### Conclusion
Our hypothesis is ______. According to the data we've gathered, the execution-time
